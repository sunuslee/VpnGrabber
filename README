thanks to asvpn.com , the site provide good vpns
thanks to google.com , their gmail alias support
made this software work perfectly!

here is how it work:
signup in asvpn.com and verified a email addres
will recieve a verify link,click that link we will
get a free vpn account , which lasts ONE HOUR

so , this software can automatically register a account
and send a request to verified email , and finally .
login the email, fetch the verified mail , analyze and
fetch the verified link. all you need to do is quite simple
1:
In the very first attempt : run with a SpeciaToken as a parameter:
./VpnGrabber IlikeVPN
then, the software will use those username and password :
IlikeVPN_0001
IlikeVPN_0002
IlikeVPN_9999
i think u won't use this more than 9999 hours ,aren't you?

2:
After the very first attempt
Just run it WITHOUT ANY PARAMETERS
the username and password are automatically generated
so all  you need to do is just click the verified the link
and change VPN username and password

P.S
I hope someone can make a script or something like
that to automatically set up vpn settings.
like fill in the username and password:<
